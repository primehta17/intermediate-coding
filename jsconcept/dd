During my recent job search, I interviewed with Abhibus for the SD2 Frontend Engineer role. The process was rigorous, insightful, and packed with real-world scenarios. Although I had to decline the offer due to compensation, the experience was truly rewarding.

🔹 Round 1 – JavaScript Mastery (Hands-On) 
Pure JS, no frameworks—just logic and fundamentals.
✅ Output-based questions on let, var, const 
✅ Async behavior with setTimeout, Promise, fetch – and their combinations 
✅ Function composition challenge:
function sum5(num){ return num+5; }
function multiply3(num){ return num *3; }
function subtract2(num){ return num-2; }

function consolidate(...fns){
 // 3 approaches I shared:
 // 1. Iterate from last to first
 // 2. Reverse + reduce
 // 3. Use reduceRight (interviewer’s pick)
 return function(val){
 return fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), val);
 };
}

const evaluate = consolidate(sum5, multiply3, subtract2);
console.log(evaluate(5)); // Output: 16
✅ Implement debounce polyfill 
✅ Implement Promise.all() polyfill

🔹 Round 2 – React Deep Dive
 From architecture to async flows.
⚛️ React architecture and rendering
📝 Build a simple TODO list 
🔄 Redux vs Redux Toolkit – deep dive 
⏳ Async handling in React (thunks, effects, etc.) 
📁 Project-specific questions 
🧠 Optimal solutions for real-world requirements

🔹 Round 3 – Theory & Experience
 No coding, just deep discussions.
🌐 Optimization, migration, domain-specific questions (network, HTTP) 
🏗️ Architecture breakdown of my previous projects 
🧠 Behavioral and decision-making questions

🔹 Round 4 – Vision & Culture Fit 
A blend of career reflection and product thinking.
📈 My career journey and approach to new challenges 
🧪 UI/UX critique of Abhibus and enhancement suggestions 
🤝 Team bonding, Agile practices, collaboration

🎯 Final Outcome:
 I was selected for the SD2 Frontend Engineer role!
While I couldn’t accept due to compensation, I’m proud of the journey and grateful for the opportunity to engage with such a thoughtful interview process.

💡 Key Takeaways:
* Core JS knowledge is still king
* Real-world React scenarios matter more than textbook answers
* Communication and architecture clarity go a long way
* Every round is a chance to grow

If you're preparing for frontend interviews, I hope this helps! Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss prep strategies, resources, or just geek out over JS and React.
